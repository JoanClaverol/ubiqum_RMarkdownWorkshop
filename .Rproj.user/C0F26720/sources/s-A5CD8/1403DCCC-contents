# This is a header

I'm a paragraph, hi! I can do cool thinks like:

* *Be in italics*
* Be **Bold**
* Or be ~~wrong~~

Below is a code chunk

```{r}
# Load the data inside your system
data <- read.csv("../data/Blackwell_Hist_Sample.csv")

# Show the summary of the data
summary(data)
``` 

```{r eval=FALSE}
hist(data$age)
```

```{r}
plot(age ~ amount, data = data)
```

The minimum age is `r min(data$age)` and the maximum age is `r max(data$age)`.
